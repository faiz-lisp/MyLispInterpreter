MyLispInterpreter
=================

This is a very tiny Lisp (Scheme flavor) dialect interpreter implemented by me
as part of my studies about functional programming when I was an undergraduate
student.

There's no completeness intention here. This project has only educational
purposes.

Currently the code is kind of hard to understand, especially due the lack of
comments. I intend to solve this soon.

If you want to know about the dialect covered by the interpreter, look into
the lib/ directory. There's some functions implemented there.

Hope it be nice to somone else =).
